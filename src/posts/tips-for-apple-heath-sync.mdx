I recently had a lot of trouble getting my Apple Health data to sync to a new iPhone. After a couple
nerve-wracking days where I thought my nearly 10 years of health data were lost, I finally got everything
in a working state again. I learned a lot about how iCloud sync works for Apple Health, so in case it's useful,
I'll write up my findings here.

After getting the new phone, all of my health data didn't transfer. I was stuck with only 6 months of data, all my
achievements gone, and more importantly, all of my historical cycling training data was gone. After 24 hours with no progress
toward my data restoring, I started to get worried. Thankfully, another day later, things were looking better.

## TL;DR - My Findings

1. **Apple Health data is not part of your device backup**. Apple Health data is synced to iCloud separately - similar to how photos are synced.
   This makes sense, because the data can sync between multiple devices easily (to iPad, for example).

2. **Your iPhone must be unlocked to restore health data**. Apple considers your health data as highly sensitive, so it's always encrypted (this is good). This does mean, however, that health data
   will only restore from iCloud _while your device is unlocked_. I can't find much reference to this fact in any official documentation around
   restoring from a backup, but when enabling iCloud health sync on a new iPad the notice does confirm this detail.

   This is the main one that got me - my phone is usually locked, so I didn't understand why it wasn't updating the data, especially overnight.

3. **You can force an iCloud sync by performing a backup**. I've actually known this one for a while, but it came in handy here. Whenever my iPad
   gets out of sync and is missing the latest health data, I manually perform a backup, and voilà, my health data is updated. I figured this would
   work on the iPhone too, and it did seem to help whenever the data syncing got "stuck."

## My Setup

I have, as far as I can tell, an abnormally large Apple Health database. I've been tracking workouts since
watchOS 1 back in 2015, and I've been wearing an Apple Watch nearly 24/7 ever since. My health database takes up
around 10 GB on my phone right now.
