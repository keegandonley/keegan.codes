It's the last day of the year, and in keeping with tradition, I want to take a moment to reflect on 2024!

I continued in my role at Kizen, working on some exciting projects that hopefully I can talk more about soon! I also started riding my bike again
and got pretty serious about road cycling! I did a few fun rides this year including my first 100 km group ride. Overall, I focused less
on side projects and more on my hobbies and career this year, but keep reading to hear about one of my favorite projects from the year!

## From My Blog

It was a busy year! Here's a quick walk back through all the posts I wrote:

My first post of the year was about [a common code smell, and some potential improvements](https://keegan.codes/blog/reacting-to-prop-changes-in-react-functional-components) regarding changing props:

I went on to review some the [architecture decisions I made back in 2023](https://keegan.codes/blog/reflecting-architecture-decisions-1-year), and how I feel about them today:

In April, I found myself missing hackathons a bit and decided to spend a weekend hacking on a project and see how far I could get. I build [thirty bot, and wrote about the process](https://keegan.codes/blog/introducing-thirsty-bot). It's an
application for generating cocktails based on ingredients you have on hand! I really enjoyed building this and it's one of my favorite projects from the year.

As part of that project, I learned about [Vercel Deployment Protection](https://keegan.codes/blog/how-to-use-vercel-deployment-protection-next-rsc) to manage my Next.js preview deployment security:

When I finished [Thirty Bot](https://thirsty.bot), I wrote an [in-depth review of the project](https://keegan.codes/blog/ai-app-in-72-hours) and the various tools I leveraged to build it!

I like to write about CSS from time to time, and this year I wrote about [media queries and how they can be an accessiblity tool](https://keegan.codes/blog/using-css-media-queries-touchscreen):

I also got to go to a few conferences this year! First up was React Miami, which was a first for me! I wrote up a [summary of my time there](https://keegan.codes/blog/react-miami-2024-recap):

Next, I went to Render ATL in July! This conference in Atlanta is my favorite one of the year, and it was a ton of fun again! I wrote [a summary of that one too](https://keegan.codes/blog/recap-render-24), and I'll be going again in 2025!

For the third conference, I got a chance to speak on a panel! This was at San Antonio Startup Week, and I really enjoyed it! I want to do more of these going forward in the new year.
I wrote [a blog post about some of the discussions](https://keegan.codes/blog/sasw-2024), including some videos of the panel:

<PostPreview slug="sasw-2024" />

Finally, I wrote [a bit about data ownership and how platforms can lock away our data](https://keegan.codes/blog/i-own-my-data), and what I do to make sure I own my data:

<PostPreview slug="i-own-my-data" />

## Happy Holidays!

Thanks for reading this year! I hope you enjoyed something I wrote, and I'm looking forward to writing more in 2025! Happy holidays and happy new year!
