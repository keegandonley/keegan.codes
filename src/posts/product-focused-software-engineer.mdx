I've called myself many things over the course of my career so far. I've been a "web developer,"
a "full stack developer," a "frontend engineer," and a "software engineer," just to name a few.
Lately, I've taken to calling myself a "product-focused software engineer." Before I dive in to
what that means to me, I want to look at why those other terms didn't quite cut it for me.

## What's in a Name?

I'm about to write (and hopefully you're about to read) quite a few words about what made-up
title I call myself. Why does it matter? Maybe it doesn't. At the end of the day, I'm going
to be writing code to solve problems no matter how I frame it.

But, I think there's something to be said for carefully choosing how to frame my role and my work. There
was a time that if you asked me what I did for work, I'd say I was a web developer. I was maintaining Wordpress sites,
building themes and plugins, and maybe writing a few plugins here and there. That's a far cry from the
kind of engineering work I do today. I'm not _not_ a web developer, but there came a time where I didn't identify
as much with that title.

## What's a Full-Stack Developer Anyways?

One of the more prolific terms I see is "full-stack developer." I tried this one out for a while
